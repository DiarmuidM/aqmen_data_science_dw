### Stata Workshop (July 2018)

### A two day hands-on workshop led by Professor John MacInnes and Dr Diarmuid McDonnell, University of Edinburgh.

<br>

### Topics: 

The course introduces participants to the skills required to discover data sources and organise raw data for data analysis. Practical operations such as matching and merging files, recoding measures, documenting data and storing data will be covered. There will be an emphasis on developing accurate, efficient, transparent and reproducible working practices when analysing data.

### Rationale: 

There are many organisations that increasingly require employees to understand 
data, and to analyse data using statistical methods. 

The known universe of data with potential value for organisations is constantly expanding. A consequence of the new forms of data is that they are not usually in a format that is ready to analyse. Datasets are often unsystematic and messy and they require a great deal of work to be undertaken before they can be used for data analysis. Data wrangling, which is sometimes referred to as data munging, or data enabling, is the process of organising raw data and transforming it into formats that enable data analyses to be undertaken.

Many organisations report that they have an absence of data analysis skills. Other organisations report that some employees have skills but lack confidence in exercising them. The lack of skills and capacity is currently a major 
obstacle to some organisations undertaking data analysis. 

This course will provide an fast-track, comprehensive introduction for employees wishing to 
rapidly improve their data wrangling skills.
